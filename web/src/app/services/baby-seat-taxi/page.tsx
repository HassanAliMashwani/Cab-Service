              Safety First: Never Travel Unsecured in Perth
            </h2>
            <p>
              In Western Australia, children under seven years of age must be secured in an approved, properly fastened child car restraint. Although standard taxis have certain exemptions, no parent wants their baby or toddler travelling without a properly anchored car seat, particularly on busy 100 km/h motorways like the Mitchell Freeway or Tonkin Highway.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you book with us, we pre-install the exact child restraint appropriate for your child&apos;s age and weight before arriving at your doorstep. You don&apos;t have to lug heavy, awkward car seats through airport terminals or worry about installing them yourself in a rush.
            </p>

              Multiple Child Seats &amp; Family Van Space
            </h3>
            <p>
              Have twins, multiple children, or travelling with grandparents? Standard 4-seater cars cannot legally fit two car seats plus three adults. Our 10-seater maxi cabs can comfortably accommodate multiple child restraints alongside adult passengers, prams, strollers, and holiday baggage.

              Sanitised &amp; Pre-Inspected Restraints
            </h3>
            <p>
              All our child restraints meet strict Australian Safety Standards (AS/NZS 1754). Harnesses, buckles, and fabrics are routinely cleaned and sanitised between journeys, ensuring your little ones enjoy a clean, hygienic ride.
